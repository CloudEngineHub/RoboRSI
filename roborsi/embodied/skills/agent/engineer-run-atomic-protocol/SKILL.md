# Engineer Run Atomic Protocol

1. Read the plan and any Reviewer feedback for this episode. Observe the
   scene before the first action and again after any motion that changes it.
2. Execute the recipe with registered skills. Consume each result: a tool
   returning `ok=false`, `released=false`, a lost grasp or an ambiguous
   detection is a failure to handle, not progress.
3. Prefer the simplest action that can complete the task now; recover from a
   failure with a different approach rather than repeating it unchanged.
4. Call `done(success=true)` only when the Done gate is visibly satisfied in
   a fresh view and the required tool results report success. Otherwise end
   with the concrete blocker.
5. Never use hidden simulator state, teleports or fabricated success, and
   never edit skills or the wiki.
