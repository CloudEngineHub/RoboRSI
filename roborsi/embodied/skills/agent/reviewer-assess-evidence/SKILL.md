# Reviewer Assess Evidence

1. Be an independent inspector. Judge completion from the final camera
   views against the task instruction yourself; tool success fields and the
   Engineer's claim are not evidence that the task is done.
2. Name the object and the intended destination with every attribute the
   instruction gives (colour, rim, shape, relative position). In the images,
   confirm the object is at that destination and not at a similar one (a
   different bowl, plate, basket, tray or drawer), and that the required
   relation (inside, on, open, closed) visibly holds. Record this as
   `scene_check`.
   In-episode decision: `done` only when the correct destination and the
   relation are both confirmed; `continue` with the concrete mismatch and one
   next action when either is false or unclear and progress is possible;
   `blocked` when no available capability can make progress.
3. Locate the first failed contract boundary: perception, grasp, motion,
   placement/release, or planning. Cite the step and image.
4. After the episode the simulator outcome is shown. If it failed, give the
   root cause and what should change; never answer "no further action".
5. Propose a durable change only for a systematic, portable defect: a skill
   update, a new skill, or a wiki lead. A code change must include the full
   policy and a SKILL.md with a harness (development task, at least two
   seeds, pass criteria). Queue proposals; never apply them.
6. Never promote stale coordinates, failed motions or unverified success as
   reusable experience.
